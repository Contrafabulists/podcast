<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about Audrey's fellowship (!!!) and Audrey's talk in Edinburgh. We also talk about how neoliberalism and libertarianism are baked into "the Silicon Valley narrative" and into the Trump Administration's agenda.</p>

<p>Warning: This episode contains cursing. Apologies. It's Kin's fault. We really are trying to make this a PG / PG-13 podcast.</p>

<p>Here are the stories we referenced:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/30/driverless">Driverless Ed-Tech: The History of the Future of Automation in Education</a>" by Audrey</li>

</ul>

<p>Feedback is welcome. (You should <a href="mailto:kinlane@gmail.com">email Kin</a> with it though, not Audrey.)</p>

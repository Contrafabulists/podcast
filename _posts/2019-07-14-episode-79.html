<p>Welcome to the 79th episode of the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' irregular discussion of the tall tales told about technology.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about one of our least favorite fabulisms, the claim that software is eating the world.</p>

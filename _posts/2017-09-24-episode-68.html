<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about automated decision-making at GitHub (that took Kin's sites offline briefly yesterday) and Facebook's automated decision making regarding its advertising (that has apparently taken American democracy offline).</p>

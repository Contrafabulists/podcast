<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>(Apologies for the sound quality. We are in New York without our normal recording set-up. Also, apologies for the length. We do normally try to keep this to 30 minutes or so, but Audrey had a lot to say...)</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about how Google (and other tech companies) are reshaping public policy and the narratives about public education.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' (somewhat) weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about how the technology industry and the technology press missed the whole Russian bot thing. Oh and AltSchool. Audrey might have rambled on about AltSchool.</p>

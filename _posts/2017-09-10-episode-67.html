<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>(Apologies for the sound quality. We are in New York without our normal recording set-up. And apologies for the two f-bombs.)</p>

<p>In this episode, we talk about fake news and natural disasters, Facebook and political advertising, and the Equifax data breach.</p>

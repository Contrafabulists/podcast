<p>Welcome to the Contrafabulists podcast, <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a>' (somewhat) weekly discussion of the latest technology (and politics of technology) news.</p>

<p>We are back after a lengthy break to talk about 2017: what happened in tech and what happened in politics and what happened to The Contrafabulists.</p>
